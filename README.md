# CS-290_Web-development-
 In particular we’ll work towards building a complete web application that uses the following things: On the client-side: HTML and CSS to define a page’s content and how it looks. Client-side JS to provide interactivity to a page. On the server-side: Server-side JS (Node.js and Express) to implement the server logic. Server-side templating to allow us to dynamically generate content for our pages. Server-side routing to aid in dynamic page creation and to help provide an API our client-side code can communicate with. Data storage: Mongo DB to store our application data.   In addition to all this stuff, we’ll also learn how to use Git and GitHub to manage our source code.
